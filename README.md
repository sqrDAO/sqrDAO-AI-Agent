## Setup

### Setting Up the Bot on Telegram

To set up your bot on Telegram, follow these steps:

1. **Open Telegram**: If you haven't already, download and install the Telegram app on your device or use the web version.

2. **Find BotFather**: In the Telegram app, search for `@BotFather` and start a chat with it. BotFather is the official Telegram bot that helps you create and manage your bots.

3. **Create a New Bot**:
   - Type `/newbot` and send the message.
   - BotFather will ask you for a name for your bot. This is the display name that users will see.
   - Next, you will be prompted to choose a username for your bot. The username must end with `bot` (e.g., `sqrdao_bot`).

4. **Get Your Bot Token**: After successfully creating your bot, BotFather will provide you with a token. This token is essential for your bot to connect to the Telegram API. It will look something like this:
   ```
   123456789:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ
   ```

5. **Store Your Token**: Make sure to store this token securely. You will need to add it to your `.env` file in your project directory later as follows:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
   ```

### Setting Up Google Custom Search Engine

To set up Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) for your bot, follow these steps:

1. **Go to Google Custom Search**: Visit the [Google Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) page.

2. **Create a New Search Engine**:
   - Click on the "Add" button to create a new search engine.
   - Fill in the required fields:
     - **Sites to Search**: Enter the websites you want to include in your search engine. You can add multiple sites.
     - **Name**: Give your search engine a name.
   - Click on the "Create" button.

3. **Get Your Search Engine ID**:
   - After creating the search engine, you will be taken to the control panel.
   - Find your **Search Engine ID** in the control panel. You will need this ID for your bot.

4. **Enable the Custom Search API**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing project.
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Library**.
   - Search for "Custom Search API" and enable it for your project.

5. **Create API Credentials**:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
   - Click on "Create Credentials" and select "API key".
   - Copy the generated API key. You will need to add it to your `.env` file.

6. **Store Your API Key and CSE ID**: Add the following lines to your `.env` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   GOOGLE_CSE_ID=your_google_cse_id
   ```
